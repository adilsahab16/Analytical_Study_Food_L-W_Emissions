# Food Waste & GHG Emissions - Exploratory Analysis Using Python

This is an exploratory analysis of global food loss and food system GHG emissions in different regions using Python (Pandas and matplotlib), which examines how dominant trends have evolved over the last 30 years and the factors that affect these trends.
